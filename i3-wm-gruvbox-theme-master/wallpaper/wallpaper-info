The kitty and gas mask wallpaper were not mine originally and were modified by myself to use a
gradient of the gruvbox colorschem blue and dark gray colors. I use nitrogen to set the wallpapers. https://github.com/l3ib/nitrogen Here are the original links where I found the wallpapers:

here also for any who might want it. I got it from here: http://wallpapercave.com/wp/vp75NPD.jpg
The grootify wallpaper is another image I found and added a gradient /
resizing to be a wallpaper. The original image is from http://wallpapersafari.com/w/fY15vT/
